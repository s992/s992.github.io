Yesterday, I decided to pull the trigger on updating to Windows 8.1. It went smoothly, but I couldn't seem to get Octopress working for me. Luckily, Daniel Auger [posted](http://nerditorium.danielauger.com/blog/2013/06/22/setting-up-an-existing-octopress-blog-on-a-new-computer/) a quick snippet (originally posted by [@dlobckdotorg](https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg)) on how to get back up and running. If you're moving Octopress to a new computer, make sure you save that post! Just in case either of their sites go away, I've reproduced it as a Gist here: https://gist.github.com/s992/23d35ebad8e8988c02c5
