My name is Sean Walsh. I'm a husband, father, and football fan. When I'm not busy trying to convince my wife to put my son into a Steelers outfit, I like to make websites. After I got out of the Army in 2009, I knew I wanted to do *something* with technology, but I wasn't sure what. In early 2010, I finally found my calling as a web developer. I got my start in a ColdFusion shop and worked quickly to devour as much knowledge as I could.

Since those humble beginnings, I've worked hard to learn as much possible. I fully believe in using the best tool for the job, and since then I've done development in a variety of languages - ColdFusion, PHP, Groovy, and Java, just to name a few. I've always been a huge fan of JavaScript, and recently I've been making an effort to dive into Node. Coding is fun, and I don't see any reason to pigeonhole myself into a single language or toolset.

Over the past few years, I've come to really enjoy working on the front end. I've built quite a few sites with Angular - which I love - and am looking forward to getting some solid experience with React.

I guess the gist of this is that I love learning and I hope I can use my blog to share my experiences with others. I definitely don't blog as often as I'd like to, but I hope you'll find my posts useful.

If you want to get in touch, your best bet is to reach out to me via e-mail, Twitter, or by adding a comment to one of my posts. You can also find me on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn.
