My name is Sean Walsh. I'm a web developer who works primarily with ColdFusion and JavaScript, but I love experimenting with any languages and technologies that I can get my hands on. I've been building websites since the third grade and started doing it professionally in 2010. I don't blog as often as I should, but I hope you'll find my posts useful.

If you want to get in touch, you can reach out to me on any of these channels:
