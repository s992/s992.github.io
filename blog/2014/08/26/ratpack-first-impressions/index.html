I didn&#39;t make room in my schedule to go to any of the sessions, but I did add it to my (long) list of stuff to check out. Most things that end up on that list have a 50/50 chance of ever making it into my editor.</p><p>Luckily, I found an excuse to check it out - and I&#39;m glad I did. My current project at work requires me to interface with a third party web based API, but that API doesn&#39;t actually exist just yet. Using Ratpack, I was able to quickly mock up the API and then code against my mock. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately!), the application <em>is</em> for work and I can&#39;t share it. What I can share, however, is my first impression of Ratpack.</p><h3 id=documentation>Documentation</h3><p>The first thing I do when I&#39;m checking out a new library or framework is head straight to the documentation. Ratpack has a <a href=http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/index.html>manual</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/api/">API docs</a>. The manual (as described in the <a href=http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/intro.html#how_to_read_the_documentation>&quot;How to read the documentation&quot;</a> section) features a high level overview of Ratpack concepts.</p><p>Looking through the manual, it&#39;s obvious that Ratpack is a work in progress. Several sections are missing entirely and replaced by &quot;TODO&quot; blocks. This was a point of frustration, but between the manual and the API docs I was able to get enough of an understanding to cobble a workable application together. Building a Ratpack application today requires some research and frustrated Googling, but ultimately I was able to find everything I needed.</p><p>I imagine the manual in its current state will be more useful for non-Groovy projects, as it seems that a majority of the &quot;TODO&quot; blocks are located in the <a href=http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/groovy.html#groovy>Groovy section</a>.</p><h3 id=examples>Examples</h3><p>After I&#39;m done scanning the documentation, I like to check out examples of the codebase. There&#39;s no shortage of example Ratpack applications: you can find five examples <a href=https://github.com/ratpack>here</a>, three of which are Groovy based - example-books, example-ratpack-gradle-groovy-app, and example-ratpack-standalone-groovy-script.</p><p>I was working with Gradle, so I checked out example-ratpack-gradle-groovy-app first. Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t been touched in eight months and seems to have stopped working. I was unable to build it, so I moved on to example-books, which is also Gradle based. This one ran, and I was able to poke around a little bit and get a feel for it.</p><p>I should note that at this time I didn&#39;t really have a strong understanding of how a Ratpack application is structured. There&#39;s a lot of stuff going on in example-books, and most of it went right over my head. I ultimately ended up cutting down example-books to create a completely barebones Ratpack example that doesn&#39;t really do anything, but writing it helped me get a better grasp on what exactly was necessary to get a Ratpack application started. You can find that example <a href=https://github.com/ratpack/example-books.git>here</a>.</p><h3 id=setup>Setup</h3><p>The manual lists two options under the &quot;Setup&quot; heading: the Gradle plugin and Lazybones project templates. At this point, I had no desire to look into Lazybones (which, by the way, seems like a fine project - you can find it right <a href=https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones>here</a> on GitHub), so I headed to the <a href=http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/setup.html#using_the_gradle_plugins>Gradle section</a>. Unfortunately, it&#39;s one of the sections that has nothing but a &quot;TODO.&quot;</p><p>There is another section of the manual dedicated to <a href=http://www.ratpack.io/manual/current/gradle.html#building_with_gradle>building with Gradle</a>, so I&#39;m not really sure what the maintainers are planning to add to the Setup &gt; Gradle section. Regardless, I was able to find what I was looking for in this section and it was trivial to create a Gradle build file that would run my (not yet created) Ratpack application.</p><h3 id=coding>Coding</h3><p>One of my favorite things about Groovy is how easy an API can be to work with when using DSLs. Ratpack is no exception: all of your endpoints are configured via the handlers DSL. Here&#39;s an example of an application with two endpoints: <code>/hello</code> and <code>/goodbye</code>.</p><pre><code class="hljs groovy">ratpack {
    handlers {
        get(<span class=hljs-string>"hello"</span>) {
            render <span class=hljs-string>"Hello, World!"</span>
        }

        get(<span class=hljs-string>"goodbye"</span>) {
            render <span class=hljs-string>"Goodbye, World!"</span>
        }
    }
}</code></pre><p>It works exactly as you would expect it to - when navigating to example.com/hello, &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is sent to the browser. And, of course, navigating to example.com/goodbye results in &quot;Goodbye, World!&quot;</p><p>Later this week, I&#39;ll be writing another post that looks at the code behind a Ratpack application more in depth. For now, I&#39;ll just say that I found Ratpack&#39;s DSL very intuitive and I enjoyed writing code with it.</p><h3 id=community>Community</h3><p>This is a short bullet point, but I just wanted to point out that there is a <a href="http://forum.ratpack.io/">forum</a> for discussing Ratpack. The forum seems fairly active and I was able to find some very helpful information there.</p><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>I found Ratpack to be an enjoyable framework to work with. If you don&#39;t mind referencing a few different sources of documentation (and probably a bit of trial and error), I would highly recommend checking it out.</p></div><footer><nav class=pagination><a href=http://swalsh.org/blog/2014/07/17/running-the-groovy-console-from-gradle class=pull-left>&laquo; Running the Groovy Console from Gradle</a> <a href=http://swalsh.org/blog/2014/09/07/migrating-octopress-to-a-new-computer class=pull-right>Migrating Octopress to a New Computer &raquo;</a></nav></footer></article></div><div class=row><div class="col-md-8 col-lg-7 col-xl-5 center-block"><h1>Comments</h1><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>var disqus_shortname = "swalsh",
